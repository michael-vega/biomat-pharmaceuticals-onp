### This workflow describes the generic metatranscriptomics pipeline used for the manuscript, "Pharmaceutical biotransformation is influenced by photosynthesis and microbial nitrogen cycling in a benthic wetland biomat"

### Additional details and steps are described in the manuscript and supporting information, as well as on The Wrighton Lab GitHub page: https://github.com/TheWrightonLab/

### Download filtered metatranscriptomic reads: NCBI and JGI Gold Accessions are available in Table S9 of the manuscript

### The majority of commands were performed using a Slurm job management system

### All commands use default parameters if not specified

### Packages / Softwares Used ###

-----------------------
### Begin Workflow ###

1. Unzip JGI filtered reads using gunzip
	Inputs: zipped filtered reads files
	Outputs: unzipped filtered reads files

2. Deinterleave forward and reverse reads from the unzipped fastq file from Step 1 using deinterleave_fastq.sh
	Inputs: filtered reads file from Step 1
	Outputs: deinterleaved forward and reverse reads 

3. Trim the filtered reads from JGI using sickle. 
	Inputs: forward and reverse reads from Step 2
	Outputs: trimmed forward and reverse reads
	Parameters: pe, -t = Sanger

4. Create reference from assembly for read mapping using bbmap
	Inputs: MAG database (dereplicated medium and high quality only) from metagenomics workflow
	Outputs: reference index from assembly 

5. Map filtered and trimmed reads to MAG database using bbmap
	Inputs: trimmed reads from Step 3, bbmap reference index from Step 4 
	Outputs: sam files
	Parameters: ambiguous = toss, usejni = t, length tag = t, idtag = t, idfilter = 0.99, printunmappedcount =t

6. Convert sam files to bam files using 'samtools view'
	Inputs: sam files from Step 5
	Outputs: bam files

7. Sort bam files using 'samtools sort'
	Inputs: bam files from Step 6
	Outputs: sorted bam files

8. Count how many mapped metaT reads mapped to the concatenated MAG gene database (i.e., .gff files from DRAM) using HTSeq-count
	Inputs: sorted bam file from Step 7, .gff files from DRAM annotation of MAGs (metagenomics workflow)
	Outputs: counts text file 

9. Filter counts using base R and edgeR
	Inputs: counts text file from Step 8
	Outputs: filtered counts matrix
	Parameters: filter scaffolds with less than one raw count in at least three samples i.e., rowSums(cpm(counts_file_matrix)>1) >= 3

10. Create DGElist object and normalize with TMM using edgeR
	Inputs: filtered counts matrix from Step 9, sample metadata (i.e., coldata), grouping details
	Outputs: TMM normalized filtered counts matrix 
	Parameters: method = "TMM"
